<p>PFnatic is a professional eSports organization consisting of players from around the world, across a variety of games. On March 14th, 2011, Fnatic entered the League of Legends scene with the acquisition of myRevenge. Fnatic is one of the strongest European teams since the early days of competitive League of Legends, having been the champion of the Riot Season 1 Championship. Fnatic has participated the finals of the LCS championship all six times, winning 5 of them and only dropping one to Alliance. </p>
<b>History</b>
<p>
After the departure of Huni and Reignover, joining Immortals, and YellOwStaR joining Team SoloMid, Fnatic was reformed and assembled Gamsu, Spirit and Noxiak as their newest team members. The Fnatic team had a hard time finding the right synergy in the bot lane, thus ending Week 4 of the 2016 EU LCS Spring with a 5-3 standing. This triggered the decision to make roster changes, targeting their bottom lane as Noxiak was not improving as fast as planned. On February 9th, 2016, it was announced that Noxiak will be stepping down from their starting lineup and will be replaced by Johan "Klaj" Olsson.[7]

After 7 weeks of the EU LCS, Fnatic travelled to Poland to participate in IEM Katowice, which is their first international tournament together as a new team. For Klaj this is the first time to play at such big event, while for Spirit this is the return after performing incredibly well last year as a member of Team WE. During the start of the tournament, Fnatic faced some struggles and lost again Qiao Gu Reapers, which placed them in the lower bracket. However during the next games, they turned the tables and beat Counter Logic Gaming and Qiao Gu Reapers 2-1, which placed Fnatic in the semifinals. The next day they beat the Chinese opponent, Royal Never Give Up in the semifinals, but lost the finals against reigning world champion SKT T1. </p>
